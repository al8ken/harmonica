    Create a ``pyvista.UnstructuredGrid`` from a set of prisms

    Parameters
    ----------
    prisms : list or 2d-array
        List or 2d-array with the boundaries of the prisms.
        Each row contains the boundaries of each prism in the following order:
        ``west``, ``east``, ``south``, ``north``, ``bottom``, ``top``.
    properties : dict or None (optional)
        Dictionary with the physical properties of the prisms.
        Each key should be a string and their value as a 1D array.
        If None, no property will be added to the
        :class:`pyvista.UnstructuredGrid`.
        Default to None.

    Returns
    -------
    pv_grid : :class:`pyvista.UnstructuredGrid`
        :class:`pyvista.UnstructuredGrid` that represents the prisms with their
        properties (if any).

    Return the vertices of the given prism

    Parameters
    ----------
    prism : list or 1d-array
        List or 1d-array with the boundaries of a single prism in the following
        order: ``west``, ``east``, ``south``, ``north``, ``bottom``, ``top``.

    Returns
    -------
    vertices : 2d-array
        2D array with the coordinates of the vertices of the prism. Each row of
        the array corresponds to the coordinate of a single vertex in the
        following order: ``easting``, ``northing``, ``upward``.
        The order of the vertices is fixed to be compatible with VTK.
